# 5 Lessons from Building Multiple Startups

After founding several companies and working on countless projects, I've accumulated a mental collection of lessons – some learned the hard way, others through close observation. Here are five insights that have shaped how I approach building products and companies.

## 1. Ship Fast, Learn Faster

The biggest mistake I made early on was perfectionism. I spent months polishing a product before showing it to anyone, only to discover that users wanted something completely different.

**What changed**: I embraced rapid iteration. Now I aim to get a minimal version in front of users within weeks, not months. The feedback loop is where the real learning happens.

### The 80/20 of MVPs

Your MVP should be:
- **Functional**: It actually solves the core problem
- **Ugly**: Polish comes later; validate the concept first
- **Focused**: Do one thing well rather than many things poorly

```typescript
// Early version mindset
const mvp = {
  features: ["core_value_proposition"],
  polish: "minimal",
  timeline: "weeks",
  goal: "validate_assumptions"
};

// Not this
const perfectProduct = {
  features: ["everything_imaginable"],
  polish: "pristine",
  timeline: "months",
  goal: "impress_everyone"
};
```

## 2. Your First Idea Will Be Wrong (And That's OK)

Every successful company I know has pivoted or significantly evolved from their original vision. Instagram started as a check-in app. Twitter was a podcasting platform. Slack was a gaming company.

The pattern isn't that these founders had perfect ideas from day one. It's that they were **willing to change direction** when the data pointed elsewhere.

### Signs It's Time to Pivot

- Users consistently request features outside your roadmap
- A "side feature" gets more engagement than your main product
- You're constantly fighting uphill against user behavior
- The market you're targeting isn't responding

## 3. Distribution Beats Product (Usually)

This is painful to admit as someone who loves building things, but it's true: **an okay product with great distribution often wins over a great product with poor distribution**.

I learned this with Lucky. We built an incredibly polished AI shopping assistant, but struggled with user acquisition. Meanwhile, competitors with clunkier products but better marketing strategies were growing faster.

### Distribution Strategies That Work

1. **Community-first**: Build where your users already are
2. **Content marketing**: Share genuinely useful insights (like this post)
3. **Partnerships**: Leverage others' audiences
4. **Word of mouth**: Make sharing part of the product experience

The best scenario? Build distribution thinking **into** the product from day one.

## 4. Hire for Trajectory, Not Credentials

Early hiring is critical. I used to over-index on credentials – top schools, big company experience, impressive resumes. What I've learned is that **trajectory matters more than pedigree**.

Look for people who:
- Learn rapidly from experience
- Take ownership without being asked
- Have demonstrated growth in their recent work
- Align with your mission (this is non-negotiable)

### The "Dinner Test"

I ask myself: Would I want to have dinner with this person to discuss the problems we're working on? If the answer isn't an enthusiastic yes, it's usually a no.

Startups are intense. You'll spend more time with your co-founders and early employees than with your family. Chemistry and shared values matter enormously.

## 5. Build in Public

This one transformed how I work. Sharing progress publicly – the wins, the failures, the lessons – has multiple benefits:

- **Accountability**: Public commitments are harder to break
- **Feedback**: Your audience becomes a sounding board
- **Network effects**: People discover you and want to help
- **Personal brand**: Valuable for fundraising, hiring, and partnerships

### What "Building in Public" Looks Like

- Share weekly progress updates
- Write about technical challenges you're solving
- Post about failures and what you learned
- Engage authentically with your community

The key is **authenticity**. People can smell fake transparency from a mile away. Share real struggles, not just highlight reels.

## Bonus: Take Care of Yourself

This deserves its own post, but I'll say it here: **you can't build a sustainable company while running yourself into the ground**.

I learned this the hard way through burnout. Now I prioritize:
- Regular exercise (non-negotiable)
- Adequate sleep (7-8 hours)
- Time for relationships
- Hobbies outside of work

Ironically, being more balanced has made me *more* productive, not less.

## Applying These Lessons

These insights don't guarantee success – there's no formula for that. But they've helped me avoid common pitfalls and move faster toward product-market fit.

The meta-lesson? **Stay curious, stay humble, and keep learning**. The day you think you've figured it all out is the day you stop growing.
