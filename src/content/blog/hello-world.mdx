# Hello World

Welcome to my new blog! This is a space where I'll be sharing my thoughts on software engineering, product development, and the interesting problems I'm solving.

## Why a blog?

I believe that writing is one of the best ways to clarify your thinking. By forcing myself to articulate concepts and ideas, I hope to deepen my own understanding while potentially helping others who might be facing similar challenges.

## What to expect

I plan to write about:
- **Web Development**: Tips and tricks for React, Next.js, and TypeScript
- **AI Engineering**: Experiences building with LLMs and AI agents
- **Product Design**: Thoughts on building intuitive user interfaces
- **Career**: Lessons learned on my journey as a software engineer

Stay tuned for more!
